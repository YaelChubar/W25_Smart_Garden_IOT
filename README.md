## Project Overview
The Smart Garden Project automates plant care with minimal manual intervention. Using an ESP32-based system, it ensures optimal plant growth in just three simple steps:

1️⃣ Set up your plant profiles – Define the needs of each plant.

2️⃣ Calibrate the sensors – Ensure accurate readings for soil moisture, temperature, and more.

3️⃣ Monitor your garden – Use a mobile app to track real-time data and system status.
