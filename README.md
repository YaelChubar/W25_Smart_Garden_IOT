## Project Overview
The Smart Garden Project automates plant care with minimal manual intervention. Using an ESP32-based system, it ensures optimal plant growth in just three simple steps:

1️⃣ **Set up your plant profiles** – Specify the requirements of each plant, such as the ideal soil moisture level and whether it needs direct sunlight.

2️⃣ **Calibrate the sensors** – Make sure soil moisture readings are accurate.

3️⃣ **Monitor your garden** – Use a mobile app to track real-time data and system status.  

## Features
The Smart Garden supports three modes of operation:
- **Automatic Mode** – The system autonomously controls irrigation and monitoring based on sensor data.
- **Manual Mode** – Users can manually control irrigation and other settings via the mobile app.
- **Offline Mode** – The system continues to operate autonomously even without an internet connection.

### Key Features:
- **Wi-Fi Enrollment using WifiManager** – Easily set up and connect the system to a Wi-Fi network.
- **Moisture Sensor Calibration** – Ensures accurate soil moisture readings for efficient watering.
- **Automatic Irrigation** – Watering is triggered based on real-time moisture levels.
- **Cover to Prevent Direct Sun Exposure** – Protects sensitive components from overheating.
- **Handshake Protocol for Android App Communication** – Enables reliable data exchange between the ESP32 and the mobile application.
- **RGB Light Status Indicator** – Provides visual feedback on system status.
